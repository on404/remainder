# Break Reminder Script

This Python script is designed to help users maintain healthy work habits by reminding them to take regular breaks while working on the computer. It prompts users to take short breaks after a certain duration of work, helping to reduce eye strain, fatigue, and improve productivity.

## Features

- **Interval Breaks:** After every two intervals of work (each interval configurable), the script prompts the user to take a short break.
- **Extended Break:** After a predefined number of interval breaks, the script suggests an extended break to allow for relaxation and rejuvenation.
- **Cross-Platform:** The script is compatible with both Windows and Unix-like systems, ensuring a consistent experience across different platforms.
- **Minimal User Interaction:** The script runs in the background, requiring minimal user interaction. Users can opt to extend breaks if needed or confirm their readiness to resume work.
- **Customizable Settings:** Users can easily customize the duration of work intervals, break durations, and other settings to suit their preferences.
